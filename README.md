# Pigeons in Holes - A Mini Zine on the Pigeonhole Principle
Inspired by the [research work](https://decomposition.al/zines/communicating-chorrectly-zine.pdf) of Professor Lindsey Kuper and UCSC alumnus Ali Ali, I created this zine as a creative way to share a Discrete Math topic that I find fascinating â€” the Pigeonhole Principle!

I plan to add a few pages about the Division Principle to this zine soon.
